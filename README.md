# Java E-Shop Application

This project is a Java-based e-shop application designed to showcase available products and allow users to purchase or order items. It was developed as part of a learning experience to understand Java programming and object-oriented principles.

## Features

- **Item Display:**
  - Shows a list of available items to users.
  - Item details are managed using a text file (`ITEM_LIST.txt`).

- **Purchasing and Ordering:**
  - Users can purchase available products.
  - If a product is out of stock, users can place an order for it.
  - Sales and orders are recorded in text files (`sales.txt`, `orders.txt`) for transaction tracking.

- **Object-Oriented Design:**
  - Implements key object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
  - Utilizes classes and objects to model the e-shop's functionality and product management.
